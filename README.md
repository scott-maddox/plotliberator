This project is designed to be a free, open-source alternative to [DataThief](http://www.datathief.org/). It can be used to extract data from plot images.

The [source code](http://github.com/scott-maddox/plotliberator) and [documentation (coming soon)](http://scott-maddox.github.io/plotliberator) are graciously hosted by GitHub.
